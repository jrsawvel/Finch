# Finch

*updated Aug 22, 2018*

My test site: <http://finch.soupmode.com>.

At the moment, Finch does little. 

A text file contains the URLs of the feeds.

A Lua script executes in cron. 

The script reads the feeds file, accesses the feeds, creates an HTML file for each feed, and creates a homepage HTML file with the links to each feed HTML file.

Maybe I'll add a web interface to manage the feeds, to manage new and unread posts, etc.

I doubt that I go as far as supporting the interesting Microsub spec, produced by the IndieWeb community, for the client and the server.
